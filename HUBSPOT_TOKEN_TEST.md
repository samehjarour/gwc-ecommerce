# 🧪 HubSpot Token Test Results

## ✅ Server Running with HubSpot Token

**Token:** `eu1-c40c-676d-466c-8b66-0d18699b84d1`
**Status:** Server started successfully
**URL:** `http://localhost:3000`

---

## 🧪 How to Test

### **Step 1: Test the Quote Form**

1. **Open your browser:** `http://localhost:3000/quote2`
2. **Fill out the form:**
   - Select platforms (e.g., Shopify, Amazon)
   - Select products (e.g., Electronics, Fashion)
   - Enter contact details:
     - First Name: Test
     - Last Name: User
     - Email: test@example.com
     - Phone: +971501234567
     - Company: Test Company
3. **Submit the form**

### **Step 2: Check Server Logs**

Watch the terminal for these messages:

**✅ Success (HubSpot Working):**
```
Using HUBSPOT_ACCESS_TOKEN from environment
Syncing contact to HubSpot...
HubSpot contact created: 123456789
Quote submitted: [quote-id]
```

**❌ Failure (Token Issue):**
```
HubSpot API Error: 401
Failed to sync HubSpot contact
Quote submitted: [quote-id] (still saved to DB)
```

### **Step 3: Verify in HubSpot**

1. Go to: [HubSpot Contacts](https://app.hubspot.com/contacts/146936524/contacts)
2. Search for: `test@example.com`
3. Check if contact was created with all properties

## 🎯 What Should Happen

If the token is valid:

1. ✅ Quote form submits successfully
2. ✅ Contact created/updated in HubSpot CRM
3. ✅ All properties mapped correctly:
   - Name, Email, Phone, Company
   - Origin Country Multi
   - Destination Country Multi
   - Shop System (platforms)
   - Product (categories)
   - Message (additional info)
4. ✅ Server logs show: "HubSpot contact created: [ID]"

## 🔧 Token Format Check

Your token: `eu1-c40c-676d-466c-8b66-0d18699b84d1`

**Expected format:** `[region]-[uuid]`
- ✅ Region: `eu1` (Europe region)
- ✅ Format looks correct

**Note:** This appears to be an API key format, not a Private App token.

**If this doesn't work, you may need:**
- A Private App token (starts with `pat-eu1-...`)
- Or an OAuth access token

---

## 🚀 Alternative Test: API Call

Test the token directly with HubSpot API:

```bash
curl -X GET \
  "https://api.hubapi.com/crm/v3/objects/contacts?limit=1" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer eu1-c40c-676d-466c-8b66-0d18699b84d1"
```

**Expected response if token is valid:**
```json
{
  "results": [...]
}
```

**Expected response if token is invalid:**
```json
{
  "status": "error",
  "message": "This request is not properly authorized..."
}
```

## 📝 Next Steps Based on Results

### **If It Works:**
1. ✅ Add token to Netlify environment variables
2. ✅ Redeploy
3. ✅ Test on production

### **If It Doesn't Work:**
1. Check token type (API key vs Private App token)
2. Generate a Private App token instead:
   - HubSpot → Settings → Integrations → Private Apps
   - Create app with `crm.objects.contacts` scopes
   - Copy the `pat-eu1-...` token
3. Test with the new token
