- Tooltip: "Units fulfilled and shipped per month. Used for both fulfillment and shipping calculations."
- Icon: Send
- **Key Change:** This ONE input drives both:
  - Fulfillment (pick & pack) costs

## ðŸ”„ **Calculation Logic Changes**

### **Package Count:**
**OLD:** Separate input for packages
**NEW:** `packages = outboundUnits`

**Rationale:** 
- Option 1 from feedback: "This input can be used for both outbound handling (pick & pack) and for ship cost calculation"
- Simplifies user input
- Most accurate for majority of use cases
- If customers need different ratio, they can request custom quote

### **Months in Storage:**
**OLD:** User input (0.1 to X months)
**NEW:** Fixed at 1 month

**Rationale:**
- Calculator is for "Monthly Sample Invoice"
- Month 1: Inbound â‰ˆ Storage
- Month 2+: Storage = (Prev Storage + Inbound - Outbound)
- Simplifies input, focuses on monthly billing

---

## ðŸŽ¨ **UI/UX Improvements**

### **Visual Hierarchy:**
1. **Product Size** - Most important decision
2. **Monthly Volumes** - Core business metrics
3. **Delivery Options** - Service level choices
4. **Promotional Offer** - Value proposition

### **Color Coding:**
- Primary color: Icons and highlights
- Green: Promotional offers, monthly total
- Muted: Helper text and explanations
- Size buttons: Primary when selected, outline when not

### **Spacing & Layout:**
- Left column: All inputs (scrollable)
- Right column: Results (sticky feel)
- Cards for logical grouping
- Consistent padding and gaps

## ðŸš€ **Technical Implementation**

### **New Component:**
`/client/src/components/GWCRateCalculatorV2.tsx`

### **Size Presets Object:**
```typescript
const SIZE_PRESETS = {
  'Small': {
    dimensions: { length_cm: 25, width_cm: 20, height_cm: 5, weight_kg: 1.5 },
    examples: ['Phone accessories', 'Jewelry', 'Small cosmetics', 'Books'],
    maxInfo: 'Up to 35cm Ã— 35cm Ã— 35cm, 2kg'
  },
  // ... Medium, Large, Extra Large
}
```

### **State Management:**
```typescript
- selectedSize: 'Small' | 'Medium' | 'Large' | 'Extra Large'
- inboundUnits: number
- storageUnits: number
- outboundUnits: number
- returnUnits: number
- deliverySpeed: 'Next Day' | 'Same Day'
- paymentMethod: 'Prepaid' | 'COD'
- showPromo: boolean
```

### **Auto-Calculation:**
